A simple app that enables you to add additional (or "unsupported") languages to your device's locale settings, if the OEM (*ahem* **Xiaomi**) doesn't let you.

Some OEMs, particularly Xiaomi with MIUI/HyperOS, limit users to selecting only one language or locale. This restriction can lead to issues, such as apps displaying incorrect characters due to Han unification, where characters in one language may appear in another. For example, without Japanese added as a locale, apps may show Chinese characters instead of Japanese ones.
