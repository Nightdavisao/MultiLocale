# MultiLocale
A simple app that allows you to select multiple languages in your Android device, if the OEM (*ahem* **Xiaomi**) doesn't let you.
# Requirements
* Android 7.0 (SDK 24) or more.
* Shizuku/root or ADB to grant one of the needed permissions for changing the device's locale settings (android.permission.CHANGE_CONFIGURATION).
